# Portfolio
An evolving portfolio to showcase my development through personal projects and my bootcamp program

Having heavily used jQuery in learning javascript, I wanted to stick with vanilla javascript here. The UI utilizes Flexbox, CSS Grid, and Materialize.

On full screen, a Materialize Carousel is used to display images, while on smaller screens a static list of images appears.
